Calvin also emphasized the idea of "double grace," meaning that through our union with Christ, God not only forgives our sins but also gives us the ability to live a life that glorifies Him (Book 3, Chapter 14, Section 11).\n\nThe Westminster Shorter Catechism, which I mentioned earlier, also teaches that glorifying God is our chief end. The catechism says that "the chief end of man is to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever," and that we do this by obeying God\'s commands, enjoying His presence, and living for His glory.\n\nSo not only is the idea of glorifying God and enjoying Him forever supported by Scripture, but it was also emphasized by early Reformers like Calvin and enshrined in catechisms like the Westminster Shorter Catechism.',
