	<h1>Exploring the Question 5 of the Westminster Shorter Catechism: Are there more Gods than One?</h1>	
	<p>One of the most foundational truths of the Christian faith is the belief in one true God. The fifth question of the <strong>Westminster Shorter Catechism</strong> asks the question "Are there more Gods than one?" with the clear and concise answer "There is but one only, the living and true God."</p>
	<p>This answer is consistent with the whole message of the Bible, which teaches the unity and uniqueness of God. </p>
	<br>
	<h2>What Does the Bible Say About This?</h2>
	<p>There are several Bible passages that speak to the idea that there is only one God:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Deuteronomy 6:4 - "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one."</li>
		<li>Isaiah 45:5-6 - "I am the LORD, and there is no other; apart from me there is no God."</li>
		<li>1 Corinthians 8:4 - "We know that an idol is nothing at all in the world and that there is no God but one."</li>
		<li>Ephesians 4:6 - "One God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all."</li>
	</ul>

	<p>These verses, among others, make it clear that there is only one true God who exists eternally and who deserves our worship and adoration.</p>

	<br>
	<h2>What About Other Gods?</h2>
	<p>As straightforward as the answer in the Westminster Shorter Catechism may seem, it begs the question: are there other "gods" that people may worship and follow?</p>
	<p>The Bible clearly teaches that there are false gods who do not actually exist and who cannot save us from sin and death. In fact, the Scriptures sometimes use the term "gods" to refer to idols, which are man-made objects of worship that cannot see, hear, or act (Psalm 115:4-8).</p>
	<p>Other religions may also claim that there are many gods, but these claims are incompatible with the teachings of the Bible, which shows the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as one and true God. </p>

	<br>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>The fifth question of the Westminster Shorter Catechism, "Are there more Gods than one?" answers a fundamental question about the Christian faith. The belief in one true God is rooted not only in the Westminster Shorter Catechism, but more importantly in the Scriptures themselves. There is only one God, who is the living and true God, who is deserving of our fullest worship and adoration.</p>
