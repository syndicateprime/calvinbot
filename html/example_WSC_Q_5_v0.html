Absolutely! Here is the in-depth answer to the question "Are there more Gods than one?" according to the Westminster Shorter Catechism:

<h1>Are there more Gods than one?</h1>

<p>No, there is only one true God.</p>

<h2>Explanation</h2>

<p>The Bible teaches that there is only one true God, who is the Creator and Ruler of the universe. This is affirmed throughout both the Old and New Testaments. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
	"There is none like you, O Lord; you are great, and your name is great in might. Who would not fear you, O King of the nations? For this is your due; for among all the wise ones of the nations and in all their kingdoms there is none like you. They are both stupid and foolish; the instruction of idols is but wood!" - <em>Jeremiah 10:6-8</em>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
	"This is what the Lord says - Israel's King and Redeemer, the Lord Almighty: 'I am the first and I am the last; apart from me there is no God.'" - <em>Isaiah 44:6</em>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
	"For there is one God and one mediator between God and humans, Christ Jesus, himself human." - <em>1 Timothy 2:5</em>
</blockquote>

<p>The truth that there is only one true God is also supported by natural reason. There can only be one being who is supremely powerful, wise, and good, and it is this being we call God. There cannot be more than one being who fits this description, as they would be in competition with one another, which would make neither of them truly supreme over all things.</p>

<h2>Application</h2>

<p>Knowing that there is only one true God has a number of important implications for our daily lives. First, it means that we should only worship and serve Him. We should not look to any other gods or idols for salvation, help, or guidance. Second, it means that we should give God the glory and honor that only He deserves, recognizing that He is the Creator and sustainer of all things. And third, it means that we should put our trust in Him alone, knowing that He is the only one who can truly save and deliver us.</p>

<blockquote>
	"I am the Lord; that is my name! I will not yield my glory to another or my praise to idols." - <em>Isaiah 42:8</em>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
	"I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me." - <em>John 14:6</em>
</blockquote>

<p>So in summary, according to the Westminster Shorter Catechism, there is only one true God, as affirmed in both the Bible and by natural reason. This has important implications for how we live our lives, as we should worship and serve God alone, give Him the glory He deserves, and put our trust in Him alone for salvation and deliverance.</p>
