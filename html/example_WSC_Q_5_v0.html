		<h1>The Westminster Shorter Catechism</h1>
		<h2>Question 5: What else did God create?</h2>
		
		<p>The <strong>Westminster Shorter Catechism</strong> is a summary of Christian doctrine written in the 17th century to help people understand what the Bible teaches about God, man, sin, and salvation. It is used by many Reformed churches as a tool for catechesis, which is the process of teaching people the basic principles of Christianity.</p>

		<p>Question 5 of the Westminster Shorter Catechism asks, "What else did God create?" The answer is, "God created all things by his powerful Word, and all his creation was very good; everything flourished under his loving rule."</p>

		<p>So, what does this mean? It means that the Bible teaches that God, out of nothing, created everything that exists by the power of His Word (Genesis 1:1-31, Psalm 33:6, Hebrews 11:3). God's creation was not only good, but "very good," which means that it was perfect and reflected the character of a loving and wise Creator (Genesis 1:31). Everything in the universe, from the tiniest microbe to the biggest galaxy, is part of God's good creation and is sustained by Him (Colossians 1:17).</p>

		<p>But why did God create? He created out of His own free will, for His own glory and pleasure (Revelation 4:11). God is infinitely wise, holy, loving, and powerful, and therefore it was right and good for Him to create a world that reflects those attributes. In other words, God created the world to reveal His glory and to invite His creatures to enjoy, worship, and serve Him.</p>
		
		<h3>GOD'S CREATION REVEALS HIS GLORY AND ATTRIBUTES</h3>
		<p>God's creation tells us something about who He is. The Psalmist David writes: "The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky proclaims the work of his hands. Day after day they pour out speech; night after night they communicate knowledge. There is no speech; there are no words; their voice is not heard. Their message has gone out to the whole earth, and their words to the ends of the world" (Psalm 19:1-4).</p>

		<p>When we look at the beauty and complexity of the natural world, we see evidence of God's wisdom and power (Proverbs 3:19-20, Romans 1:20). The Bible tells us that the whole creation groans and longs for the day when it will be released from its bondage to corruption and brought into the freedom and glory of God's children (Romans 8:19-22).</p>

		<h3>GOD'S CREATION INVITES US TO WORSHIP AND SERVE HIM</h3>
		<p>God's creation also invites us to worship and serve Him. The Psalms are full of exhortations to praise God for His works of creation (Psalm 104, for example). Jesus Himself pointed to the beauty of the lilies and the birds as evidence of God's care and provision (Matthew 6:25-34).</p>

		<p>Furthermore, as image-bearers of God, we are called to be stewards of His creation and to use it for His purposes (Genesis 1:26-28, Psalm 8). This means that we are to use the resources of the earth responsibly, without destroying or abusing them, and to work for justice and care for the poor (Proverbs 11:31, 14:31, 19:17, 28:27, Isaiah 58:7-11).</p>

		<p>In summary, Question 5 of the Westminster Shorter Catechism reminds us that God is the Creator of all things, that His creation is good and reflects His glory and attributes, and that we are invited to worship and serve Him by taking care of His creation and using it for His purposes.</p>
