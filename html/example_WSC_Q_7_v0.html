	<h1>What are the decrees of God?</h1>
	<p>The term "decrees of God" refers to His eternal plan and sovereign will by which He has foreordained everything that will come to pass in the universe.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The <strong>Westminster Shorter Catechism</strong> teaches that the decrees of God include predestination and election. </p>
	<br>
	<p>The doctrine of predestination states that God has chosen certain people for salvation even before the foundation of the world. The Bible provides ample support for this doctrine:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Ephesians 1:4-5 - "For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love he predestined us to be adopted as his sons through Jesus Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and will." </li>
		<li>John 15:16 - "You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit--fruit that will last."</li>
		<li>Acts 13:48 - "When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and honored the word of the Lord; and all who were appointed for eternal life believed."</li>
	</ul>
	
	<br>
	
	<p>Election refers to God's choice of certain individuals or groups for a particular purpose or task. The Bible provides numerous examples of God exercising his choice regarding the election of specific people:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Deuteronomy 7:6 - "For you are a people holy to the LORD your God. The LORD your God has chosen you out of all the peoples on the face of the earth to be his people, his treasured possession."</li>
		<li>1 Peter 2:9 - "But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light."</li>
		<li>Jeremiah 1:5 - "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations."</li>
	</ul>

	<br>
	
	<p>The decrees of God also include His providence, which refers to His ongoing control over all events in the universe. This means that God is sovereign over everything that happens, whether good or bad, and He uses everything for His purposes. Here are a few Bible verses that support this idea:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Proverbs 16:9 - "In their hearts humans plan their course, but the LORD establishes their steps."</li>
		<li>Romans 8:28 - "And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose."</li>
		<li>Job 1:20-21 - "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I will depart. The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised."</li>
	</ul>

	<br>
	
	<p>To summarize, the decrees of God refer to His eternal plan and sovereign will by which He has foreordained everything that will come to pass in the universe, including predestination, election, and providence. While these ideas may be difficult to fully comprehend, they are clearly taught in Scripture and are central to a Christian understanding of God's nature and character. </p>
