	<h1>The Shorter Catechism - Question 7: What is God?</h1> 
	<br>

	<p>Question 7 in the Westminster Shorter Catechism is, "What is God?" This is a profound question that has fascinated people throughout history. According to the Bible, there are many things that can be said about God.</p> 
	<br>

	<h2>God is Creator</h2>
	<p>First, we can say that God is the Creator of everything that exists. In the book of Genesis, we see that God spoke the world into existence over the course of six days. Here are a few verses that talk about God's creative power:</p> 
	<ul>
		<li>Genesis 1:1 - "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth."</li>
		<li>Psalm 33:6 - "By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, their starry host by the breath of his mouth."</li>
		<li>Isaiah 44:24 - "This is what the Lord says - your Redeemer, who formed you in the womb: I am the Lord, the Maker of all things, who stretches out the heavens, who spreads out the earth by myself."</li>
	</ul> 
	<br>

	<h2>God is Holy</h2>
	<p>Another thing that can be said about God is that he is holy. This means that God is completely separate from sin and evil, and is perfectly pure and righteous. The Bible teaches that God is so holy that no one can even look upon him and live:</p> 
	<ul>
		<li>Isaiah 6:3 - "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty; the whole earth is full of his glory."</li>
		<li>Leviticus 19:2 - "Speak to the entire assembly of Israel and say to them: 'Be holy because I, the Lord your God, am holy."</li>
		<li>Exodus 33:20 - "But," he said, "you cannot see my face, for no one may see me and live."</li>
	</ul> 
	<br>

	<h2>God is Triune</h2>
	<p>One of the most amazing and mysterious things that can be said about God is that He is triune. This means that God exists in three persons - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit - who are all equally God. This may be difficult to fully understand or comprehend, but it is an important aspect of the Bible's teachings about God:</p> 
	<ul>
		<li>Matthew 28:19 - "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."</li>
		<li>2 Corinthians 13:14 - "May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."</li>
	</ul> 
	<br>

	<h2>God is Love</h2>
	<p>Finally, we can say that God is love. This means that God's very nature is characterized by love and compassion for all of his creation. The Bible teaches that God loved the world so much that he sent his Son, Jesus Christ, to die for our sins:</p> 
	<ul>
		<li>1 John 4:8 - "Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love."</li>
		<li>John 3:16 - "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."</li>
		<li>Romans 5:8 - "But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us."</li>
	</ul> 
	<br>

	<p>So we can see that there are many things that can be said about God, and that each one is important for understanding who God is and how we should relate to Him. </p>
