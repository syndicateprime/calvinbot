		<h2>What Are the Decrees of God?</h2>
		<p>The Westminster Shorter Catechism states that "The decrees of God are his eternal purpose, according to the counsel of his will, whereby, for his own glory, he hath foreordained whatsoever comes to pass."</p>

		<p>This means that all things that happen in the world are the result of God's eternal plan, which he has decided since before the beginning of time, and everything exists for his glory.</p>

		<h2>What Does the Bible Say About the Decrees of God?</h2>

		<p>The Bible teaches that God is sovereign over all things and that nothing happens apart from his will. Here are some verses that support this idea:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Ephesians 1:11 - "In him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will."</li>

			<li>Isaiah 46:10 - "Declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things not yet done, saying, â€˜My counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my purpose,'" "</li>

			<li>Proverbs 16:4 - "The Lord has made everything for its purpose, even the wicked for the day of trouble."</li>

			<li>Romans 11:36 - "For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen."</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>What Does this Mean for Us?</h2>

		<p>Understanding the decrees of God should give us great comfort and encouragement. We can trust that God is in control of everything in our lives and in the world, and that everything that happens is ultimately for his glory and our good.</p>

		<p>This should lead us to worship Him and seek to live lives that honor Him, knowing that all of our efforts will be used by Him to accomplish His eternal purposes.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>"The decrees of God are a doctrine full of comfort, as well as of necessary importance. Our faith is under constant attack from the evil one and his forces. With the knowledge that God is sovereign over all things and that everything happens according to His eternal plan, we can take comfort in the fact that He is always with us, always loves us, and always has our best interests at heart. So let us rest in the knowledge of God's sovereignty, and let us trust in His infinite wisdom and goodness."</p>
