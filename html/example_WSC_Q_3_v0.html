		<h1>What do the Scriptures mainly teach? - Westminster Shorter Catechism</h1>

		<h2>Question 3</h2>
		<p>Question 3 of the Westminster Shorter Catechism asks and answers:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>What do the Scriptures principally teach?</p>
			<p>The Scriptures principally teach, what man is to believe concerning God, and what duty God requires of man.</p>
			<footer>Westminster Shorter Catechism</footer>
		</blockquote>

		<p>In other words, the Bible tells us what we need to know about God in order to believe in Him, and what we need to do in order to live in a way that pleases Him.</p>

		<h2>What the Scriptures Teach About God</h2>

		<p>The Bible is the inspired, infallible, and authoritative word of God, and it tells us everything we need to know about who God is, what He has done, and what He expects of us. Here are just a few of the many things that the Scriptures teach us about God:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>God is the Creator of the universe (Genesis 1:1)</li>
			<li>God is holy and just (Isaiah 6:3, Psalm 89:14)</li>
			<li>God is loving and merciful (Exodus 34:6-7, Psalm 103:8)</li>
			<li>God is one, yet exists in three persons (Deuteronomy 6:4, Matthew 28:19)</li>
			<li>God became man in the person of Jesus Christ (John 1:1-14, Philippians 2:5-8)</li>
			<li>God offers salvation to all who repent and believe in Jesus Christ (John 3:16, Acts 16:31)</li>
			<li>God will judge the world and reward the righteous and punish the wicked (Revelation 20:11-15)</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>What the Scriptures Teach About Our Duty to God</h2>

		<p>The Scriptures not only teach us about God, but also teach us what God expects of us. Here are just a few of the many things that the Scriptures teach us about our duty to God:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>We are to love God with all our heart, soul, mind and strength (Matthew 22:37-38)</li>
			<li>We are to trust and obey God (Proverbs 3:5-6)</li>
			<li>We are to worship God in spirit and in truth (John 4:23-24)</li>
			<li>We are to serve God by using our gifts and talents for His glory (1 Peter 4:10-11)</li>
			<li>We are to love others as ourselves (Matthew 22:39)</li>
			<li>We are to make disciples of all nations, teaching them to obey everything that Jesus has commanded (Matthew 28:19-20)</li>
			<li>We are to persevere in faith and obedience to the end (Hebrews 10:36)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>These are just a few of the many things that the Scriptures teach us about our duty to God. As we study and meditate on the word of God, we will discover more and more about who God is and what He requires of us, and we will be equipped to live a life that brings Him glory.</p>
