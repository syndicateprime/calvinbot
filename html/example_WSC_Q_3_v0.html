		<h1>What does it mean that God is all-knowing?</h1>
		
		<p>The third question of the Westminster Shorter Catechism asks, "What do the Scriptures principally teach?" To which the answer is, "The Scriptures principally teach, what man is to believe concerning God, and what duty God requires of man." A fundamental doctrine concerning God's nature that the Scriptures teach is that God is all-knowing. </p>

		<h2>What does it mean that God is all-knowing?</h2>
		
		<p>When we say that God is all-knowing, what we mean is that He knows everything, past, present, and future. He knows all things perfectly, including our very thoughts and intentions. His knowledge is infinite, and nothing can be hidden from Him.</p>
		
		<p>This is supported by several passages in the Bible:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Psalm 147:5 - "Great is our Lord, and abundant in power; his understanding is beyond measure."</li>
			<li>Isaiah 46:9-10 - "Remember the former things of old; for I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things not yet done, saying, 'My counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my purpose,'" </li>
			<li>Hebrews 4:13 - "And no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account."</li>
			<li>Psalm 139:2-4 - "You know when I sit down and when I rise up; you discern my thoughts from afar. You search out my path and my lying down and are acquainted with all my ways. Even before a word is on my tongue, behold, O Lord, you know it altogether."</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Why is it important that God is all-knowing?</h2>

		<p>The fact that God is all-knowing is extremely significant for a number of reasons:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>It means that God is able to guide and direct our lives perfectly, since He knows what is best for us.</li>
			<li>It means that we can trust God completely, since He knows all things and cannot be deceived or misled.</li>
			<li>It means that God can hold us accountable for our actions, since He knows everything we do and think.</li>
			<li>It means that we can take comfort in the fact that God sees and knows everything, even if we are going through difficult times and feel alone.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>A few more verses that illustrate the importance of God's all-knowing nature:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Proverbs 15:3 - "The eyes of the Lord are in every place, keeping watch on the evil and the good."</li>
			<li>Jeremiah 16:17 - "For my eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from me, nor is their iniquity concealed from my eyes."</li>
			<li>Psalm 139:7-12 - "Where shall I go from your Spirit? Or where shall I flee from your presence? If I ascend to heaven, you are there! If I make my bed in Sheol, you are there! If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there your hand shall lead me, and your right hand shall hold me. If I say, 'Surely the darkness shall cover me, and the light about me be night,' even the darkness is not dark to you; the night is bright as the day, for darkness is as light with you."</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>What does this mean for us?</h2>

		<p>The fact that God is all-knowing should have a profound impact on the way we live our lives. We should trust God completely and seek to do His will in all things, knowing that He knows what is best for us. We should also be comforted by the fact that God sees and knows everything, even if we feel alone in our struggles. And we should strive to honor God with our thoughts, words, and actions, knowing that He is aware of everything we do and think.</p>
