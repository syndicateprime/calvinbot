	<h1>What Do the Scriptures Mainly Teach?</h1>	
	<p>According to the <strong>Westminster Shorter Catechism</strong>, the Scriptures mainly teach what man is to believe about God and what God requires of man. </p>
	<br>
	<p>This means that the Bible's essential message is to guide humanity in understanding the nature of God and His expectations for how we should live. Here are a few Bible verses that support this:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Psalm 19:7-9 - "The law of the Lord is perfect, refreshing the soul. The statutes of the Lord are trustworthy, making wise the simple. The precepts of the Lord are right, giving joy to the heart. The commands of the Lord are radiant, giving light to the eyes. The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring forever. The decrees of the Lord are firm, and all of them are righteous."</li>
		<li>2 Timothy 3:16-17 - "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work."</li>
		<li>Psalm 86:11 - "Teach me your way, Lord, that I may rely on your faithfulness; give me an undivided heart, that I may fear your name."</li>
	</ul>

	<br>
	<p>The Bible teaches many things about God and what He requires of us. Some of these teachings include:</p>
	<h2>The Nature of God:</h2>
	<p>The Bible teaches that there is one true God, who is eternal, infinite, and unchangeable. God is the creator of everything, and He sustains all things by His power. He is perfectly holy, just, and loving, and He is worthy of our worship and praise. (Deuteronomy 6:4, Psalm 90:2, 1 Timothy 1:17)</p>
	<h2>The Condition of Man:</h2>
	<p>The Bible teaches that all human beings are sinners and have fallen short of God's glory. We are all in need of salvation, which can only come through faith in Jesus Christ. (Romans 3:23, Ephesians 2:8-9)</p>
	<h2>The Work of Christ:</h2>
	<p>The Bible teaches that Jesus Christ is the Son of God who came to earth to die for our sins and rise again on the third day. Through faith in Christ, we can be forgiven of our sins and receive eternal life. (John 3:16, Romans 5:8)</p>
	<h2>The Work of the Holy Spirit:</h2>
	<p>The Bible teaches that the Holy Spirit is the third person of the Trinity who empowers believers to live a life that pleases God. The Holy Spirit guides us, teaches us, and convicts us of sin. (John 14:26, Romans 8:26-27)</p>
	<h2>The Response of Man:</h2>
	<p>The Bible teaches that we are called to repent of our sins, believe in Jesus Christ, and follow Him as Lord. We are to love God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength, and love our neighbor as ourselves. (Mark 1:15, Matthew 22:37-40)</p>
	
	<p>These are just a few of the many teachings found in the Scriptures about what man is to believe about God and what God requires of man.</p>
