	<h1>The Work of Creation</h1>	
	<p>According to the <strong>Westminster Shorter Catechism</strong>, the work of creation is defined as follows:</p>
	
	<p><strong>Q. 9: What is the work of creation?</strong></p>

	<p>A. The work of creation is God's making all things of nothing, by the word of his power, in the space of six days, and all very good.</p> 

	<p>The Bible teaches us that, in the beginning, God created all things. He spoke into existence the heavens and the earth, and every living being that exists in them. </p>

    <p><strong>The Biblical Account of Creation:</strong></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Genesis 1:1 - "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth."</li>
		<li>Psalm 33:6 - "By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, their starry host by the breath of his mouth."</li>
		<li>Colossians 1:16 - "For in him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and for him."</li>
	</ul>

	<p>God's creation is a testament to His infinite wisdom and power. Every creature, every plant, and every element in nature was crafted with purpose and design. When God completed His work, He declared it "very good" and rested from His labor.</p> 

    <p><strong>The Six Days of Creation:</strong></p>

	<p>The biblical account of Creation describes how God made all things of nothing, in the space of six days:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Day 1: Light (Genesis 1:3)</li>
		<li>Day 2: Sky (Genesis 1:6)</li>
		<li>Day 3: Dry ground, seas, plants (Genesis 1:9-13)</li>
		<li>Day 4: Sun, moon, and stars (Genesis 1:14-19)</li>
		<li>Day 5: Sea creatures and birds (Genesis 1:20-23)</li>
		<li>Day 6: Animals, man and woman (Genesis 1:24-31)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>This creation was good, perfect and very good. God made for Himself and His glory. "In the beginning God created everything good, so let us strive in doing His work and glorifying His name.</p>
