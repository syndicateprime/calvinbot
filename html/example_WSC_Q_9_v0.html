		<h1>The Work of Creation</h1>
		<p>According to the <strong>Westminster Shorter Catechism</strong>, the work of creation is God's making all things out of nothing,by the word of his power, in six days, and all very good</p>

        <p>The Bible shows clearly that God created the universe in six days:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Genesis 1:1 - "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."</li>
            <li>Genesis 1:31 - "And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day."</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The concept of God creating the world is also mentioned extensively in the New Testament:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Acts 17:24 - "God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands."</li>
            <li>Colossians 1:16 - "For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him."</li>
            <li>Hebrews 11:3 - "Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear."</li>
        </ul>

        <p>One of the most significant things about the work of creation is that it is a declaration of the glory of God. God's creative work reveals His infinite power, wisdom, and goodness:</p>

        <blockquote>
        	<p>"The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands. Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they reveal knowledge." - Psalm 19:1-2</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The universe that God created is a testimony to His greatness:</p>

        <blockquote>
        	<p>"For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, So that people are without excuse." - Romans 1:20 (NIV)</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>As Christians, we can appreciate the beauty of God's creation, and praise Him for the wonderful work that He has done. In doing so, we are fulfilling a small part of our duty to glorify and enjoy God forever.</p>
