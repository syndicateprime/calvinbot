	<h1>How does God execute his decrees?</h1>	
	<p>According to question number 8 of the <strong>Westminster Shorter Catechism</strong>, God executes his decrees in the works of creation and redemption. </p>
    <br>
    <p> God has decreed everything that comes to pass from the beginning of creation until the end of time. Here are a few Bible verses that demonstrate this:</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
		<li>Ephesians 1:11 - "In him we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will."</li>
		<li>Proverbs 16:4 - "The Lord works out everything to its proper end—even the wicked for a day of disaster."</li>
		<li>Isaiah 46:10 - "I make known the end from the beginning, from ancient times, what is still to come. I say, ‘My purpose will stand, and I will do all that I please.’"</li>
	</ul>
    <p>God's decrees are absolute and cannot be thwarted, but they are not the same as fatalism or determinism. God's decrees are not arbitrary or capricious; rather, they are grounded in His perfect character and are always carried out for His glory.</p>
    <p>God executes His decrees in the works of creation and redemption. In creation, God spoke everything into existence ex nihilo according to His decrees: </p>
    <br>
    <ul>
		<li>Genesis 1:3 - "And God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light."</li>
		<li>Psalm 33:6 - "By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, their starry host by the breath of his mouth."</li>
	</ul>
    <p>God's sovereignty over creation can be seen in the order, complexity, and beauty of the natural world.</p>
    <p>In redemption, God executes His decrees through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is the centerpiece of God's plan of redemption, which was decreed before the beginning of time: </p>
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li>1 Peter 1:19-20 - "But with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect. He was chosen before the creation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for your sake."</li>
		<li>Revelation 13:8 - "All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast—all whose names have not been written in the Lamb’s book of life, the Lamb who was slain from the creation of the world."</li>
	</ul>
	<p>God implements His eternal plan of redemption through Jesus Christ by sending the Holy Spirit to convict and regenerate hearts, produce faith, and produce sanctification in believers.</p>

    <br>
    <p>The sovereignty of God's decrees does not negate human responsibility or freedom. Even though God has decreed everything that comes to pass, humans still have a real responsibility for their choices, and they are held accountable for their actions. </p>
    <p>God's sovereignty and human responsibility can be true simultaneously because God's decrees encompass everything that will come to pass and because He works through secondary causes in order to accomplish His decrees.</p>
