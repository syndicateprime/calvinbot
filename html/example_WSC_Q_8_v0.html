		<h1>How Does God Execute His Decrees?</h1>
	</header>
	<section>
		<p>According to the Westminster Shorter Catechism, God executes his decrees in the works of creation and providence.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>What are decrees?</h2>
		<p>The decrees of God are His eternal purpose or plan, by which, according to His sovereign will and for His own glory, He has foreordained everything that happens. These decrees are founded on God's infinite wisdom and are unchangeable.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>What is creation?</h2>
		<p>Creation is the work of God by which He made all things out of nothing in six days according to Genesis 1:1-31. Genesis 1:27 tells us that God created man in His own image, male and female.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>What is Providence?</h2>
		<p>Providence is God's active and continual preservation and upholding of His creation. He also governs all things according to His wise and holy purposes. This is what the Bible means by "the hand of God." One example of Godâ€™s providence is the story of Joseph found in Genesis 37-50. </p>
		<br>
		<h2>Where is this taught in the Bible?</h2>
		<p>The Bible teaches that God executes his decrees in the works of creation and providence in many places. Here are a few examples:</p>
		<ul class="references">
			<li>Ephesians 1:11 - "In him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will."</li>
			<li>Genesis 1:1-31 - Describes the creation of the earth and all that exists therein.</li>
			<li>Isaiah 46:10 - "Declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things not yet done, saying, 'My counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my purpose.'"</li>
			<li>Psalms 104:24 - "O Lord, how manifold are your works!
In wisdom have you made them all;
the earth is full of your creatures."</li>
			<li>Daniel 4:35 - "all the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, and he does according to his will among the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand or say to him, 'What have you done?'"</li>
		</ul>
