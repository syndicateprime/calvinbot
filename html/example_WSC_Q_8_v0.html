	<h1>What is the Summary of the Law?</h1>

	<p>Question 8 of the <strong>Westminster Shorter Catechism</strong> asks:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>What is the summary of the Law?</p>
	</blockquote>

	<br>

	<p>The answer provided by the Catechism is:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>The summary of the Law is always to love God and to love your neighbor as yourself.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>This answer comes from several different passages in the Bible, and was affirmed by Jesus Himself when He was asked which commandment was the greatest.</p>

	<p>In Matthew 22:37-40, Jesus responds:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>"'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments." </p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>This passage, often called the "Great Commandment," summarizes the two greatest commandments found in the Old Testament (Deuteronomy 6:5 and Leviticus 19:18) and affirms their central importance in Christian faith.</p>

	<p><strong>John Calvin</strong> wrote extensively on this topic in his "Institutes of the Christian Religion." Calvin saw the summary of the law as having three components: love for God, love for neighbor, and obedience to God's commands. He believed that these three components were interconnected and could not be separated from one another.</p>

	<p>Calvin also emphasized that true love for God would lead naturally to love for our fellow human beings. In <em>Book 2, Chapter 8, Section 52</em> of the Institutes, he writes:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>"[L]et us remember that the commandment which our Lord has given us is not a cold commandment or a lifeless philosophy. For he did not refer to the table of the law as if it contained nothing but a doctrine of morals, which kills those who hear it but gives no power or grace to fulfill it. But he declared that he proposed nothing but what he himself would accomplish in us by his Spirit. This is the medicine which he offers to heal our vices, and the remedy to cure our diseases."</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>In other words, Calvin believed that true love for God would not simply be an abstract idea or a cold, legalistic ethic, but rather would be something that was actively worked out in the life of the believer through the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>

	<p>The biblical call to love God and love our neighbors means more than just having positive feelings towards them. It also calls us to tangible actions that demonstrate our love.</p>

	<p>James 2:14-17 puts it this way:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>"What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds?... Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to them, 'Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,' but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it? In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead."</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>So the summary of the law, according to the Westminster Shorter Catechism, is to love God by obeying His commands and to love our neighbors by serving and caring for them. This call to action is rooted in the Scriptures and has been affirmed by theologians and believers throughout the centuries.</p>
