	<h1>Question 6 of The Westminster Shorter Catechism Explained</h1>	
	<p>Question 6 of the Westminster Shorter Catechism is, "What do the Scriptures principally teach?"</p>
	
	<div style="background-color: #f2f2f2; padding: 20px;">
		<h3>Answer:</h3>
		<p>The Scriptures principally teach what man is to believe concerning God, and what duty God requires of man <em>(2 Timothy 1:13, 2 Timothy 3:16-17)<em></p>
	</div>

	<br>
	<p>The answer to this question highlights the two main subject areas of the Holy Scriptures: What man is to believe concerning God, and what duty God requires of man. In other words, the Scriptures are primarily focused on beliefs about God and how we should live according to His will.</p>

	<br>
	<p>Here are a few Bible verses that support this notion:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>2 Timothy 1:13 - "Hold on to the pattern of sound teaching that you have heard from me, with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus."</li>	
		<li>2 Timothy 3:16-17 - "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work."</li>	
		<li>Proverbs 2:1-6 - "My son, if you accept my words and store up my commands within you, turning your ear to wisdom and applying your heart to understandingâ€” indeed, if you call out for insight and cry aloud for understanding, and if you look for it as for silver and search for it as for hidden treasure, then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God. For the LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding."</li>
	</ul>

    <br>
	<p>Throughout the Bible, we see countless examples of God teaching His people the truth about who He is and how they should live in relationship with Him. From the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20 to the teachings of Jesus in the New Testament, the Scriptures are filled with instruction about how we should think and act as followers of God.</p>
	
	<br>
	<p>Ultimately, the Bible shows us that God is both loving and just, and that we are called to love and serve Him with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength. The Westminster Shorter Catechism's answer to Question 6 reminds us that the Scriptures provide us with everything we need to know in order to fulfill our purpose of glorifying God and enjoying Him forever (1 Cor. 10:31; Ps. 73:25-26).</p>
