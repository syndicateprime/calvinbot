	<h1>The Rule God Has Given Us on How to Glorify and Enjoy Him</h1>

	<p>The <strong>Westminster Shorter Catechism</strong> answers the question "What rule has God given to us to direct us how to glorify and enjoy Him?" with the following: "The Word of God, which is contained in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, is the only rule to direct us how to glorify and enjoy Him."</p>

	<h2>Biblical Basis</h2>
	<p>The Bible itself attests to the fact that it is the only sufficient rule for how to live a life that honors and glorifies God.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>2 Timothy 3:16-17 - "All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be competent, equipped for every good work."</li>
		<li>James 1:22-25 - "But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror. For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like. But the one who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres, being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts, he will be blessed in his doing."</li>
		<li>Psalm 119:9-11 - "How can a young man keep his way pure? By guarding it according to your word. With my whole heart I seek you; let me not wander from your commandments! I have stored up your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you."</li>
		<li>Proverbs 30:5-6 - "Every word of God proves true; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him. Do not add to his words, lest he rebuke you and you be found a liar."</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Why Scripture is the Only Rule</h2>
	<p>So why is Scripture the only rule for how to glorify and enjoy God? There are a number of reasons:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Scripture is God's inspired and authoritative word - as 2 Timothy 3:16-17 says, "All Scripture is breathed out by God." Therefore, it is uniquely suited to be our guide for how to live a life that honors and glorifies God.</li>
		<li>Scripture provides a clear and comprehensive guide - the Bible contains everything we need to know about God and how to relate to Him in a way that is pleasing to Him. It provides a clear and complete guide for how to live a life that is centered on God's glory.</li>
		<li>Any other rule or guide is subject to error - as Proverbs 30:5-6 says, we should not add to God's words, lest we be found to be liars. Any other rule, no matter how well-intentioned, is ultimately subject to the fallibility of human understanding and interpretation.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>Ultimately, Scripture is the only rule that we need to direct us on how to glorify and enjoy God. It provides a clear and authoritative guide for our lives, and it is both sufficient and necessary for our spiritual growth and wellbeing.</p>
