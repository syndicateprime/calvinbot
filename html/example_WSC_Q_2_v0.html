	<h1>What rule has God given to direct us how we may glorify and enjoy him according to the Westminster Shorter Catechism?</h1>	

	<p>According to the <strong>Westminster Shorter Catechism</strong>, God has given us a rule to direct us how we may glorify and enjoy Him, and that rule is the Bible, also called the Scriptures or the Word of God.</p>
	<p>The Bible tells us about God's character, His love for us, and His plan for our salvation through His Son Jesus Christ, which ultimately leads to our enjoying Him forever. Here are some bible verses that support this:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>2 Timothy 3:16-17: "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work."</li>
		<li>Psalm 119:105: "Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path."</li>
		<li>John 5:39: "You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me."</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Through reading and studying the Bible we can learn more about God and what it means to follow Him. We can also find comfort, guidance, and wisdom in its pages. </p>

	<p>The Bible also reveals to us the gospel message- that we are saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ, not by our own works (Ephesians 2:8-9). As we put our faith in Christ and follow Him, we are transformed into His likeness and can more fully enjoy our relationship with Him.</p>


	<p>Additionally, the Bible helps us to understand God's will for our lives and how to please Him (Romans 12:1-2). It shows us how to live according to His standards, which ultimately leads to glorifying Him and serving others (Matthew 22:37-39; John 15:12).</p>


	<p>In conclusion, the Bible is the rule that God has given us to direct us how we may glorify and enjoy Him. Through it, we can learn more about God's character, His plan for our salvation, and how to live according to His will. As we study and follow the Scriptures, we can enjoy a deep and fulfilling relationship with God, which is the ultimate purpose of our lives.</p>
