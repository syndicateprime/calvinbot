	<h1>What are the decrees of God according to the Westminster Shorter Catechism?</h1>	
	<p>The <strong>Westminster Shorter Catechism</strong> provides a succinct and comprehensive summary of the core doctrines of Christian faith. Let's explore Question 10:</p>
	<br>

	<h2>"What are the decrees of God?"</h2>
	<p>The decrees of God refer to His eternal plan and purpose for all things, which He established before the foundation of the world.</p>
	<p>The Bible teaches that God is sovereign over all aspects of creation and history, and that everything happens according to His will (Isaiah 46:10; Ephesians 1:11). God's decrees are not subject to change or revision, and everything that happens is within the scope of His perfect plan (Numbers 23:19).</p>
	<br>

	<h2>Understanding God's Decrees</h2>
	<p>God's decrees are the manifestation of His perfect and infinite wisdom, knowledge, and love. They are designed to bring about the greatest possible glory to Him and to accomplish His purposes in the world. </p>
	<p>God's decrees are mysterious and beyond human comprehension, but they are revealed to us in Scripture so that we may understand what He has revealed about Himself and His plans. </p>
	<p>The Bible tells us that all of God's decrees are good, righteous, and holy (Romans 8:28; Psalm 119:68). They are designed to promote the welfare of His people and the advancement of His Kingdom on earth.</p>

	<h2>The Relationship between God's Decrees and Human Responsibility</h2>
	<p>One of the most challenging aspects of understanding God's decrees is how they relate to human responsibility. The Bible teaches that human beings are responsible for their actions and choices, and that we will be held accountable for them on the Day of Judgment (Romans 14:12).</p>
	<p>At the same time, the Bible also teaches that nothing happens outside of God's sovereign will, and that even the sinful actions of human beings are part of His overall plan (Genesis 50:20; Acts 2:23).</p>
	<p>While these two ideas may seem contradictory or paradoxical, they can be reconciled when we consider God's infinite wisdom and knowledge. God's decrees do not negate human responsibility; rather, they encompass it and work together with it to accomplish His purposes.</p>

	<h2>The Implications of God's Decrees for Christians</h2>
	<p>As Christians, our understanding of God's decrees serves to give us comfort, hope, and assurance. We know that God is in control of all things, and that He is using even the difficult and painful circumstances of life for our ultimate good (Romans 8:28). We can rest in the knowledge that God's plan for us is perfect, and that His grace is sufficient for us in all circumstances (2 Corinthians 12:9).</p>

	<h2>Bible Verses about God's Decrees</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Isaiah 46:10 - "I make known the end from the beginning, from ancient times, what is still to come. I say, ‘My purpose will stand, and I will do all that I please.’"</li>
		<li>Ephesians 1:11 - "In him we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will"</li>
		<li>Numbers 23:19 - "God is not human, that he should lie, not a human being, that he should change his mind. Does he speak and then not act? Does he promise and not fulfill?"</li>
		<li>Romans 8:28 - "And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose."</li>
		<li>Psalm 119:68 - "You are good, and what you do is good; teach me your decrees."</li>		
	</ul>

	<h2>Bible Verses about God's Sovereignty and Human Responsibility</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Genesis 50:20 - "You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives."</li>
		<li>Acts 2:23 - "this man was handed over to you by God’s deliberate plan and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross."</li>
		<li>Romans 14:12 - "So then, each of us will give an account of ourselves to God."</li>
		<li>2 Corinthians 12:9 - "But he said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.' Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me."</li>		
	</ul>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>The Westminster Shorter Catechism teaches that the decrees of God are His eternal plan and purpose for all things. These decrees are designed to bring about the greatest possible glory for Him and to accomplish His purposes in the world. While the relationship between God's decrees and human responsibility may seem paradoxical, they work together to accomplish God's perfect plan. As Christians, we can take comfort in knowing that God is in control of all things, and that His grace is sufficient for us in all circumstances.</p>
