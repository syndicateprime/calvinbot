	<h1>How Did God Create Man?</h1>	
	<p>The <strong>Westminster Shorter Catechism</strong> teaches that human beings were created by God (Question 10), and the Bible provides us with detailed information about the creation of mankind. </p>

	<br>

	<h2>Biblical Perspective</h2>
	<p>The biblical account of creation is found in Genesis chapters 1-2. Here are some of the key takeaways:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Genesis 1:27 states that God created mankind in his own image, both male and female</li>
		<li>God formed man from the dust of the earth and breathed life into his nostrils, making him a living being. (Genesis 2:7)</li>
		<li>God then created Eve from one of Adam's ribs, making woman from man (Genesis 2:21-22).</li>
		<li>God gave Adam and Eve the responsibility to rule over creation and to be fruitful and multiply (Genesis 1:28).</li>
	</ul>

	<br>

	<h2>Impact on Humanity</h2>
	<p>Human beings were created as physical and spiritual beings, and were given a unique responsibility on earth by God. Genesis 1:26-28 tells us that God created humans with a specific purpose and authority:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>"Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.'"</li>
		<li>"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them."</li>
		<li>"And God blessed them. And God said to them, 'Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.'" </li>
	</ul>

	<br>

	<h2>Theological Perspective</h2>
	<p>The creation of man also has significant theological implications. The Westminster Confession of Faith, which is closely related to the Westminster Shorter Catechism, teaches that human beings were created to glorify God and enjoy Him forever (Chapter 4, Section 1).</p>

	<p>This means that God created humanity to reflect His attributes, to obey His commands, and to find joy and satisfaction in their relationship with Him. Ephesians 2:10 tells us that we were created in Christ Jesus to do good works which God prepared in advance for us to do. </p>

	<br>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>The creation of man is a significant event in biblical history, and has continued to impact humanity in a variety of ways. We were created to reflect God's image, to obey His commands, and to enjoy Him forever. </p>

	<p>The creation story also reminds us of the incredible power and authority of God. It highlights the importance of our relationship with Him and our responsibility to care for the world around us. As we seek to understand the origins of humanity, let us remember the theological significance of this event, and the importance of mankind in God's plan for the world.</p>
