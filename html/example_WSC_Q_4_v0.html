			<h2>The Westminster Shorter Catechism</h2>
			<p>The Westminster Shorter Catechism, a summary of Christian doctrine, provides the following answer to the question, "What is God?"</p>
			<blockquote><strong>Answer:</strong> God is a Spirit, infinite, eternal, and unchangeable, in his being, wisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness, and truth.</blockquote>
			<p>Let's unpack each part of this answer.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>God is a Spirit</h2>
			<p>The first thing the Shorter Catechism teaches us about God is that He is a Spirit. This means that God does not have a physical body like we do. He is not confined to any one place and is not limited by the laws of physics. In the Bible, Jesus said, "God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth" (John 4:24).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>God is Infinite</h2>
			<p>The second thing the Shorter Catechism teaches us about God is that He is infinite. This means that God has no limits or boundaries. He is not bound by time, space, or anything else that might limit us as humans. The Psalmist writes, "Great is our Lord, and abundant in power; his understanding is beyond measure" (Psalm 147:5).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>God is Eternal</h2>
			<p>The third thing the Shorter Catechism teaches us about God is that He is eternal. This means that God has always existed and always will exist. There was never a time when God did not exist. The psalmist writes, "Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever you had formed the earth and the world, from everlasting to everlasting you are God" (Psalm 90:2).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>God is Unchangeable</h2>
			<p>The fourth thing the Shorter Catechism teaches us about God is that He is unchangeable. This means that God does not change. He is not subject to the whims of human beings or the changing circumstances of life. The writer of Hebrews says, "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever" (Hebrews 13:8).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>God is Wise</h2>
			<p>The fifth thing the Shorter Catechism teaches us about God is that He is wise. This means that God has great understanding and knowledge. He knows all things and is never wrong. The Apostle Paul writes, "Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!" (Romans 11:33).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>God is Powerful</h2>
			<p>The sixth thing the Shorter Catechism teaches us about God is that He is powerful. This means that God has the ability to do anything He wants. There is nothing too difficult for God. The prophet Jeremiah says, "Ah, Lord God! It is you who have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm! Nothing is too hard for you" (Jeremiah 32:17).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>God is Holy</h2>
			<p>The seventh thing the Shorter Catechism teaches us about God is that He is holy. This means that God is set apart from all that is impure and sinful. He is perfectly righteous and just. The prophet Isaiah saw a vision of God and wrote, "Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!" (Isaiah 6:3)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>God is Just</h2>
			<p>The eighth thing the Shorter Catechism teaches us about God is that He is just. This means that God always does what is right and fair. He punishes sin and rewards righteousness. The psalmist writes, "The LORD is righteous in all his ways and kind in all his works" (Psalm 145:17).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>God is Good and True</h2>
			<p>The final thing the Shorter Catechism teaches us about God is that He is good and true. This means that God is completely trustworthy and faithful. He always keeps His promises and will never deceive or mislead us. The Apostle John writes, "God is light, and in him is no darkness at all" (1 John 1:5).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>The Shorter Catechism's answer to the question, "What is God?" shows us that God is not like anything else in the universe. He is a Spirit who is infinite, eternal, unchangeable, wise, powerful, holy, just, good, and true. These attributes are also demonstrated throughout the Bible, as we have seen in the various passages quoted. May we continue to worship and adore the one true God, who is so awe-inspiring!</p>
