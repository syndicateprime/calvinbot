	<h1>What is God?</h1>	
	<div>
		<p>According to the <strong>Westminster Shorter Catechism</strong>, God is a Spirit, infinite, eternal, and unchangeable, in his being, wisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness, and truth.</p>
		<br>
		<p>To understand more about what this means, let's look at each of these attributes individually with reference to the Bible:</p>
		<br>

		<h2>Spirit </h2>
		<p>In John 4:24, Jesus said, "God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth." This means that God does not have a physical body like human beings or animals. He is an immaterial, invisible, and ethereal being.</p>
		<br>

		<h2>Infinite </h2>
		<p>Psalm 147:5 says, "Great is our Lord and mighty in power; his understanding has no limit." This means that God is without measure or boundaries. He is not limited by time, space or anything. He is forever and unlimited in every way.</p>
		<br>

		<h2>Eternal </h2>
		<p>In Psalm 90:2, we read, "Before the mountains were born or you brought forth the whole world, from everlasting to everlasting you are God." This means that God has always existed and always will. Unlike human beings or other created things, God does not have a beginning or an end.</p>
		<br>

		<h2>Unchangeable </h2>
		<p>In Malachi 3:6 we read, "I the Lord do not change. So you, the descendants of Jacob, are not destroyed." This means that God is constant and reliable. He does not change in his nature, his character or his promises. He remains the same yesterday, today, and forever.</p>
		<br>

		<h2>Being</h2>
        <p>Exodus 3:14 – 15 reveals God to us as the “I Am”: “God said to Moses, “I am who I am. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: 'I am has sent me to you.'  God also said to Moses, 'Say to the Israelites, 'The Lord, the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob—has sent me to you.' This is My name forever, the name by which I am to be remembered from generation to generation'</p>
        <br>
            
        <h2>Wisdom</h2>
		<p> In Romans 16:27, we read, “...to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, be the glory forever. Amen.” This means that God has the highest intelligence to perceive and understand everything clearly; he constantly chooses the best course of action.</p>
		<br>
         
		<h2>Power</h2>
		<p> In Jeremiah 32: 17, we read, “Ah Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee.” This means that God has the supernatural ability to accomplish all that He wills and to do everything that seems impossible to mankind. </p>
		<br>
            
        <h2>Holiness</h2>
        <p> In Isaiah 6:3 we read, “And one called to another and said: “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!” Holiness means that God is completely separate from sin, He is morally perfect and untouched by anything impure or wicked. </p>
        <br>
            
        <h2>Justice</h2>
        <p> In Romans 12:19 we read, “Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.” This means that God is consistently fair and judges every person rightly and impartially, rewarding the good and punishing the wicked.</p>
        <br>
            
		<h2>Goodness</h2>
		<p>Psalm 34:8 says, "Taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed is the one who takes refuge in him." This means that God is kind, loving, merciful, and gracious with his people. </p>
        <br>
             
        <h2>Truth</h2>
        <p>Psalm 25:10 tells us, "All the paths of the Lord are loving and faithful for those who keep the demands of his covenant." This means that God is completely trustworthy and always does what he promises to do. This also means that His Word is true and authoritative, and we can trust and rely on Him always.</p>
        
        <br>
	
	    <p> In summary, God is a Spirit, infinite, eternal, and unchangeable, in his being, wisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness, and truth - this describes the Almighty Creator God that Christians worship as the one and only true God.</p>
