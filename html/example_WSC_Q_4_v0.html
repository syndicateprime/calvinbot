	<h1>The Fourth Question of the Westminster Shorter Catechism</h1>
	<p>The fourth question of the Westminster Shorter Catechism is one that provides an answer to one of the most important questions that can be asked: What is God like? The answer to that question is the foundation of all other inquiries and curiosities about our Creator. Given its importance, let's take a deeper dive into the answer provided by the Catechism:</p>

	<h2>Question:</h2>
	<p>What is God?</p>

	<h2>Answer:</h2>
	<p>God is a spirit, infinite, eternal, and unchangeable, in his being, wisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness, and truth.</p>

	<h3>God is a Spirit</h3>
	<p>When the Catechism says that God is a spirit, it means that He is not made up of physical components. God is not contained within a body, and He doesn't have a physical form that we can see or touch. Jesus says in John 4:24, "God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth."</p>

	<h3>Infinite and Eternal</h3>
	<p>God's infinite and eternal nature means that there is no limit to His existence, power or knowledge. The Bible says in Isaiah 40:28, "Do you not know? Have you not heard? 
	The Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He will not grow tired or weary, and his understanding no one can fathom."</p>

	<h3>Unchangeable in His Being</h3>
	<p>The Catechism says that God is unchangeable in His being because He is the same yesterday, today, and forever (Hebrews 13:8). God's character and nature do not shift or transform over time. </p>

	<h3>Wisdom and Power</h3>
	<p>God's wisdom and power are displayed throughout the Bible. In Job 12:13, it is written "To God belong wisdom and power; counsel and understanding are his."</p>

	<h3>Holiness, Justice, Goodness, and Truth</h3>
	<p>God's holiness is what sets Him apart from everything else. Psalm 99:9 says, "Exalt the Lord our God and worship at his holy mountain, for the Lord our
	God is holy." His justice is perfect, and He has given us His laws to follow. Psalm 7:9 declares, "Let the evil of the wicked come to an end, but establish
	the righteous; For the righteous God tries the hearts and minds." He loves us and is good to us, as evidenced by the life, death, and resurrection of His son, Jesus Christ. In John 3:16-17, it is
	written, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send
	his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him." His truth is infallible; it is the basis of all understanding. Psalm 117:2 says, 
	"For great is his love toward us, and the faithfulness of the Lord endures forever." </p>

	<p>As we can see from the Catechism's answer, God is a magnificent and multifaceted being whose character and nature are fully revealed in the Bible. Knowing God and understanding all of His attributes is important for us to be able to worship and love Him fully. This knowledge allows us to approach him with reverence and humility, knowing that we are in the presence of an awesome and holy God. </p>
